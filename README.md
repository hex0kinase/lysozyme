# Molecular Dynamics of Lysozyme
### Protein, solvated with water with neutralizing Cl- ions in cubic PBC.

#### Using GROMACS with a Jupyterlab notebook as a front-end to integrate 'gmx' cmds/output and multimedia, it remains a sinple aqueous system as a test to be replaced with transmembrane bacterial porin, OmpF. Canonical equilibration (NVT,NPT), energy minimization and trajectory parameterized analysis data in progress with plots to follow.
